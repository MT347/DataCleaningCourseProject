Course Project Code Book 
========================

This Code book is based on the feature description provided with the data(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
It has been adapted to reflect the transformations that have been made to the data.

See the README.MD file or the script run_analysis.R for a description of the transformations.




subject		integer (1..30); unique identifyer of the participatinc subjects

activity	string (WALKING
|WALKING_UPSTAIRS
|WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
|SITTING
|STANDING
|LAYING
); describes the activity observed during the observation in question

type		string (t|f); 't' indicates time signals, 'f' indicates frequency domain signals

feature		string (BodyAcc|BodyAccJerk|BodyAccJerkMag|BodyAccMag|BodyBodyAccJerkMag|BodyBodyGyroJerkMag|BodyBodyGyroMag|BodyGyro|BodyGyroJerk|BodyGyroJerkMag|BodyGyroMag|GravityAcc|GravityAccMag); indicates the feature used to describe the movement

measure		string (mean()|std()); denotes the estimated variable, 'mean()' indicates Mean value, 'std()' indicates standard deviation

orientation	string (X|Y|Z|NA); denotes 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions (where applicable), signals that or not 3-axial are marked as 'NA'

value		numeric (-1...1); observed value (mean value over all observations for this combination of 'subject' and 'activity')
